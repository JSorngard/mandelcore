**Multi threaded mandelbrot generator**

Generates a plot of the mandelbrot set using all available cpu cores. Currently has a problem with memory utilization leading to crashes for an image larger than \~7000^2 pixels.

**Future:**

Would like to make the image colored, like [this one]{https://preshing.com/20110926/high-resolution-mandelbrot-in-obfuscated-python/}.  

Would like to not distort the image just because it is not a square.
